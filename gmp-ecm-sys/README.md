# GMP-ECM-sys

[![Crate.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/gmp-ecm-sys.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/gmp-ecm-sys)

Rust low-level bindings for [GMP-ECM](https://gitlab.inria.fr/zimmerma/ecm).

## Caching the built C libraries

Building the C libraries can take some time. In order to save
compilation time, the built libraries are cached in the userâ€™s cache
directory as follows:

- on GNU/Linux: inside `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/gmp-ecm-sys` or
  `$HOME/.cache/gmp-ecm-sys`
- on macOS: inside `$HOME/Library/Caches/gmp-ecm-sys`
- on Windows: inside `{FOLDERID_LocalAppData}\gmp-ecm-sys`

To use a different directory, you can set the environment variable
`GMP_ECM_SYS_CACHE` to the desired cache directory. Setting the
`GMP_ECM_SYS_CACHE` variable to an empty string or to a single
underscore (`"_"`) will disable caching.
